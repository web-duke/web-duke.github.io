      "intro": "Full Stack Developer, I began my career by taking charge of web integration within backend-focused teams. This experience allowed me to develop a solid expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design. After serving as lead integrator, I expanded my skills to front-end and then full-stack development, enabling me to work across the entire development chain today. Self-taught and curious, I donâ€™t hesitate to step outside my comfort zone and learn new technologies to meet the challenges entrusted to me.",
