      "intro": "Full-stack developer, I started my career by taking charge of web integration within back-end focused teams. This experience allowed me to build strong expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design. After working as a lead integrator, I expanded my skill set to front-end development, and eventually full-stack. Today, I work across the entire development cycle. Self-taught and curious by nature, Iâ€™m not afraid to step out of my comfort zone and quickly learn new technologies to meet the challenges I take on.",
